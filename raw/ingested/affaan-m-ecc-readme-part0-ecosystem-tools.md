## Ecosystem Tools### Skill CreatorTwo ways to generate Claude Code skills from your repository:

#### Option A: Local Analysis (Built-in)Use the `/skill-create` command for local analysis without external services:

/skill-create                    # Analyze current repo
/skill-create --instincts        # Also generate instincts for continuous-learning-v2

This analyzes your git history locally and generates SKILL.md files.

#### Option B: GitHub App (Advanced)For advanced features (10k+ commits, auto-PRs, team sharing):

[Install GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/skill-creator) | [ecc.tools](https://ecc.tools)

# Comment on any issue:
/skill-creator analyze

# Or auto-triggers on push to default branch

Both options create:

- **SKILL.md files** - Ready-to-use skills for Claude Code
- **Instinct collections** - For continuous-learning-v2
- **Pattern extraction** - Learns from your commit history

### AgentShield — Security Auditor> Built at the Claude Code Hackathon (Cerebral Valley x Anthropic, Feb 2026). 1282 tests, 98% coverage, 102 static analysis rules.

Scan your Claude Code configuration for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and injection risks.

# Quick scan (no install needed)
npx ecc-agentshield scan

# Auto-fix safe issues
npx ecc-agentshield scan --fix

# Deep analysis with three Opus 4.6 agents
npx ecc-agentshield scan --opus --stream

# Generate secure config from scratch
npx ecc-agentshield init

**What it scans:** CLAUDE.md, settings.json, MCP configs, hooks, agent definitions, and skills across 5 categories — secrets detection (14 patterns), permission auditing, hook injection analysis, MCP server risk profiling, and agent config review.

**The `--opus` flag** runs three Claude Opus 4.6 agents in a red-team/blue-team/auditor pipeline. The attacker finds exploit chains, the defender evaluates protections, and the auditor synthesizes both into a prioritized risk assessment. Adversarial reasoning, not just pattern matching.

**Output formats:** Terminal (color-graded A-F), JSON (CI pipelines), Markdown, HTML. Exit code 2 on critical findings for build gates.

Use `/security-scan` in Claude Code to run it, or add to CI with the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/affaan-m/agentshield).

### Continuous Learning v2The instinct-based learning system automatically learns your patterns:

/instinct-status        # Show learned instincts with confidence
/instinct-import <file\> # Import instincts from others
/instinct-export        # Export your instincts for sharing
/evolve                 # Cluster related instincts into skills

See `skills/continuous-learning-v2/` for full documentation. Keep `continuous-learning/` only when you explicitly want the legacy v1 Stop-hook learned-skill flow.
